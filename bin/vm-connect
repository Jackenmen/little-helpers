# Connect to a VM created by `vm-run` or `libvirt`.
#
# In case of VMs created by `vm-run`, `<vm_name>` is equivalent to image name
# with a `tmp-` prefix and an optional `-N` suffix when multiple VMs with same name
# are running at the same time, e.g. `tmp-ubuntu2204` or `tmp-ubuntu2204-2`.
#
# Usage: `vm-connect <vm_name>`
