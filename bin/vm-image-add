# Add a Linux VM image for use by `vm-run`.
#
# Usage: `vm-image-add <image_name> <sums_url> <sum_type> <filename_pattern>`
#
# The script expects to be able to download a Linux image based on
# a provided `CHECKSUMS` file in a format returned by `sha256sum`/`sha512sum` program
# ran with or without `--tag` option. `<filename_pattern>` is used to extract
# the relevant checksum. This setup is generally supported by the data that is provided
# by the distro maintainers though there are 2 notable outliers:
# - Red Hat Enterprise Linux - requires subscription
# - Oracle Linux - does not provide checksum file in a parsable format
#
# You can find examples for different distros at:
# https://github.com/Jackenmen/dotfiles/tree/main/private_dot_config/little-helpers-vm-images
