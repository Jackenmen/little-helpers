A few small git scripts for things I do often so that I can type less.
I'm just a bit lazy...

Only tested on Windows but these are Bash scripts
so they should run just fine on Unix systems.

## Usage/Installation

To use the scripts in this repo, you should first clone it:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jack1142/git-helpers
```

After you have the repository cloned into a folder, you just need to
add the `REPO_PATH/bin` folder to your `PATH` so that the scripts in it
can be detected by git and auto-added into its namespace.

## License

Please see [LICENSE file](LICENSE) for details.
In short, this project is open source and you are free to modify
and use my work as long as you credit me.
